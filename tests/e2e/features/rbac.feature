Feature: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

  Comprehensive tests for role-based access control to ensure
  authentication and authorization work correctly.

  Background:
    Given The service is started locally
      And The system is in default state
      And REST API service prefix is /v1
      And the Lightspeed stack configuration directory is "tests/e2e/configuration"
      And The service uses the lightspeed-stack-rbac.yaml configuration
      And The service is restarted
