## What

Request tracing for Lightspeed Core using the OpenTelemetry Python SDK.

It provides:

- OpenTelemetry SDK configuration through standard `OTEL_*` environment variables at process startup
- Effective OpenTelemetry settings exposed by the `GET /config` endpoint (environment variables collected on demand and added to the endpoint response)
- Manual spans for key execution stages, following a session → trace → span hierarchy:
    - **Session:** conversation-scoped, associated with the user and environment
    - **Trace:** one per user prompt or model turn
    - **Span:** an ordered pipeline step within a trace, including intent routing, RAG context retrieval, tool execution, response generation, moderation, and conversation management
- Spans generated from LCORE internal summary objects rather than merging backend-exported spans into internal traces
- Configurable option for extraction of W3C trace context from inbound LCORE HTTP requests to preserve trace continuity across gateways
- Proper OpenTelemetry lifecycle management, including SDK initialization at startup and flushing telemetry on shutdown

When tracing is off (`OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` or exporter env not set), no spans are exported. Application-level manual span creation should remain a no-op when the SDK is disabled.

## Why

Request tracing provides visibility into how requests flow through LCORE, enabling operators and developers to understand system behavior in production.

Without tracing, it is difficult to:
- Identify latency bottlenecks across components such as RAG, LLM calls, and tools
- Localize errors to a specific stage of request handling
- Debug issues that involve multiple LCORE subsystems and backend calls
- Evaluate product behavior or understand what configurations and setups customers use in production

By introducing OpenTelemetry-based tracing, LCORE enables:
- **Request-level tracing:** A single trace covers the full LCORE request path—from an optional upstream gateway through validation, backend calls, and response assembly—making it possible to see the complete execution timeline in one place.
- **Precise latency breakdown:** Each major step (e.g., validation, RAG retrieval, LLM invocation, shield moderation) is represented as a span, allowing operators to identify which component is responsible for latency.
- **Backend abstraction:** External backends are implementation details. LCORE emits a multi-span trace per request populated from internal summaries. Backend OTel is not merged into the LCORE tree.
- **Safe observability by design:** Only structured metadata (e.g., IDs, counts) is captured in span attributes; latency is visible from span timing, avoiding exposure of raw prompts, retrieved content, or other sensitive user data.

This improves observability, reduces time to diagnose issues, and aligns LCORE with modern cloud-native monitoring practices.

## Requirements

**R1 – Tracing support**  
LCORE shall support request tracing for all requests, producing telemetry compatible with OpenTelemetry.  

**R2 – Configuration**  
Tracing shall be configurable at deployment time. The effective tracing configuration shall be inspectable at runtime so operators can verify the running setup without hunting through separate deployment manifests (secret values shall be redacted).

**R3 – Trace continuation**  
It shall be possible to continue an upstream trace when a calling service already started one, and to disable that behavior so LCORE starts a standalone trace per request. The configuration shall be documented.

**R4 – Session grouping**  
LCORE shall group all traces for a user conversation into a session container, so that multiple user prompts / model turns within the same conversation can be correlated and analyzed together. Each session shall carry a unique conversation identifier, an anonymized user id and other relevant attributes.

**R5 – LCORE-owned span tree**  
LCORE shall emit the prescribed multi-span trace per request from its own pipeline summary objects. LCORE shall not merge backend-exported spans into the trace.

**R6 – Coverage**  
Tracing shall cover the full request lifecycle, including key stages such as request handling, LLM calls, RAG retrieval, conversation management, and shield moderation.  

**R7 – Semantic conventions and data handling**  
Spans and their attributes shall follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and avoid capturing sensitive or high-volume data.  

**R8 – Lifecycle management**  
Tracing shall be properly initialized and shut down with the application, ensuring all data is flushed on shutdown.  

**R9 – Resilience**  
Tracing failures must not impact request processing or user-facing behavior.  

**R10 – Documentation**  
The feature shall include documentation describing how to enable tracing, configure required environment variables, and verify correct behavior.

## Use Cases

**U1**  
As an SRE, I want LCORE to export traces to my OTLP endpoint, so that I can monitor and alert consistently with other services.

**U2**  
As a platform engineer, I want upstream W3C trace context honored by default, with the option to disable it, so that gateway-started traces continue through LCORE when needed.

**U3**  
As a developer, I want spans for RAG, LLM, tools, and shields, so that I can localize latency and errors without storing high volume data in the trace backend.

**U4**  
As an administrator, I want tracing configurable at deploy time and the effective settings visible for inspection at runtime, so I can verify the running setup without hunting through separate deployment manifests.

**U5**  
As an SRE, I want each pipeline step (retrieval, tool call, generation, etc.) as its own LCORE span with consistent naming and metadata, without depending on backend trace export or cross-service propagation.

**U6**  
As a developer, I want remote and in-process backend integrations to produce the same trace shape from LCORE's perspective.

## Architecture

### Chosen approach (spike decisions)

| Spike decision | Choice |
|----------------|--------|
| 1 — Configuration | Environment-first (`OTEL_*`; no LCORE YAML block); `/config` scrapes env |
| 2 — SDK initialization | `opentelemetry-instrument` |
| 3 — Inbound trace context | Default W3C propagators; `OTEL_PROPAGATORS=none` to disable |
| 4 — Outbound to backends | LCORE-owned multi-span tree; no outbound propagation |
| 5 — Export topology | OTLP to a configurable endpoint only; collector deployment out of scope (operator choice) |
| 6 — Span filtering | Downstream in operator-managed collector or backend pipeline |

### Overview

Clients send requests to LCORE, which builds a structured span tree from internal pipeline summaries. External backends are not represented by their own exported spans. LCORE exports traces via OTLP to a configured trace backend for monitoring.

### Tracing boundary

LCORE exports a single coherent trace per inbound request. External dependencies (inference backends, MCP servers, databases) are implementation details - their work is reflected only in LCORE-constructed step spans.

- LCORE does **not** propagate trace context to external backends.
- LCORE does **not** depend on downstream services exporting spans into the same trace.
- Each backend interaction is represented by **one parent span** (e.g., `backend.inference`, `backend.rag.retrieve`, `backend.toolgroups.list`) whose duration covers the full call, including retries and streaming.
- Downstream services may run their own OTel independently; that is an operator concern, not part of the LCORE trace contract.

```

LCORE: TracerProvider ──► OTLP exporter ──► (optional) Collector ──► trace backend

External backends: not merged into the LCORE span tree; optional separate OTel export
```

### Configuration and SDK initialization

Spike **Decision 1** (environment-first) and **Decision 2** (`opentelemetry-instrument`).

All tracing configuration uses **`OTEL_*` environment variables** at process launch. LCORE defines **no YAML block** for tracing.

LCORE starts with **`opentelemetry-instrument`**, which initializes the SDK from `OTEL_*` before application code runs and auto-instruments supported libraries. The application does not construct or configure the SDK. Use `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` as a process-wide kill switch.

**`/config` visibility:** `GET /v1/config` handler reads relevant `OTEL_*` variables and appends them under `observability.otel` (secrets redacted).

### Inbound W3C trace context

Spike **Decision 3** (default propagators).

Use standard OpenTelemetry propagators via **`OTEL_PROPAGATORS`** (default includes W3C `tracecontext`). FastAPI auto-instrumentation extracts `traceparent` on incoming requests. Applies to inbound LCORE HTTP requests only.

To disable inbound propagation, set `OTEL_PROPAGATORS=none`.

### LCORE-owned span tree

Spike **Decision 4** (LCORE-owned spans; no outbound propagation).

External backend interactions are implementation details from a tracing perspective. LCORE does **not** inject W3C trace context on outbound backend calls and does **not** merge backend-exported spans into the trace.

Instead, LCORE constructs the full span tree per request from internal pipeline summary objects - structures that accumulate timings, inputs/outputs, retrieved sources, and tool-call records as the request is handled. Each prescribed step becomes its own span (e.g. retrieval, each tool invocation, response generation).

```python
with tracer.start_as_current_span("backend.inference") as span:
    span.set_attribute("backend.operation", "inference")
    span.set_attribute("llm.model.id", model_id)
    # ... invoke backend client ...
    span.add_event("llm.response.completed")
    span.set_attribute("llm.usage.input_tokens", ...)
```

### Export topology

Spike **Decision 5**.

LCORE's responsibility is only to export OTLP telemetry to the configured endpoint (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and related `OTEL_*` variables).

What exists behind that endpoint is out of scope for this feature and is an infrastructure/operator decision. The endpoint may point directly to an OTLP-compatible backend (e.g. LangFuse) or to an OpenTelemetry Collector, which can perform fan-out, filtering, or export to additional destinations. Deployment and configuration of any collector or downstream telemetry infrastructure are managed outside of LCORE **for now**.

### Span filtering

Spike **Decision 6**.

LCORE emits all spans defined in this specification. Filtering, sampling, scrubbing, or tail sampling is applied downstream in the collector or backend. LCORE does **not** provide per-span or per-span-group enable flags.

### Span coverage

Recommended candidate spans, grouped by functional category. Each logical operation is represented by one parent span, with child spans for underlying pipeline steps—populated only from LCORE summary objects, not from backend-exported traces.

#### Shared inference pipeline

Covers core request handling and LLM processing (`POST /v1/query`, `/streaming_query`, `/responses`, `/infer`).

|------|-------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| SSE stream lifecycle | Async generators in `streaming_query.py` / `responses.py` | Bind stream to trace |  `stream.conversation.id`; span duration → response time | `stream.first_delta`, `stream.completed`, `stream.error` |

| Authorized probe | `authorized.*` | Auth check | `authorized.ok` | — |

Health, metrics, and root endpoints are noisy and should not have manual spans, but FastAPI will still generate automatic spans. These can be filtered via `OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS` or dropped downstream.

#### Naming conventions

- **Span names:** `component.operation` (e.g., `rag.retrieve`, `llm.invoke`, `backend.inference`)  
- **Attributes:** Dot-separated namespaces (e.g., `llm.model.id`, `rag.chunks.count`, `backend.operation`)  
- **Events:** Short, past-tense, milestone names (e.g., `stream.completed`, `llm.response.finished`)  

### Prometheus metrics

LCORE continues to expose **Prometheus-compatible metrics** via `/metrics`. While OpenTelemetry tracing is introduced for spans, **metrics remain on Prometheus**.

- Continue using `/metrics` for all operational metrics.
- Expand Prometheus metrics as product needs evolve.
- Maintain low cardinality in metric labels.

### Failure handling and sensitive data

- **Export errors on request path:** Tracing failures do not affect the HTTP response; errors are logged.
- **Misconfigured exporter:** Missing or invalid `OTEL_*` exporter settings mean spans are not exported; user requests are not impacted. Operator/deployment concern, not a startup failure.
- **Span attributes:** Metadata only (lengths, hashes, IDs, coarse results). No raw prompts or retrieved content.

### Environment variables

All tracing SDK configuration uses standard OpenTelemetry environment variables at process launch.

**Global kill switch:** `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true`

**Required for export (typical):**

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`

**Common optional settings:**

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` — secrets; redacted in `/config`
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_CERTIFICATE` and client key paths — mTLS
- `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` and `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG`
- `OTEL_PYTHON_FASTAPI_EXCLUDED_URLS`
- `OTEL_PROPAGATORS` — use `none` to disable W3C extraction
- `OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS`

See the [OpenTelemetry SDK environment variables reference](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/).

### Deployment

**`docker-compose.yaml` (LCORE service)** — set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`; add headers, sampler, `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`, etc. as needed via `environment` / `env_file`.

**`Containerfile` (LCORE image)** —  
`ENTRYPOINT ["opentelemetry-instrument", "python3.12", "src/lightspeed_stack.py"]`

### Trigger mechanism

Tracing is active when the process starts with **`opentelemetry-instrument`** and a coherent set of **`OTEL_*`** values (unless `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true`). The SDK and propagators are fully configured from the environment at process launch; LCORE YAML plays no role.

## Storage / data model changes

**None.** Traces are exported; LCORE does not persist span data in application databases.

## Configuration

LCORE defines **no YAML block** for OpenTelemetry. All tracing settings are **`OTEL_*` environment variables**, set at deploy time. See Architecture → Environment variables.

### `/config` response enrichment

When **`GET /v1/config`** returns the effective configuration, the handler shall append scraped `OTEL_*` values under `observability.otel`:

```json
{
  "observability": {
    "otel": {
      "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT": "http://otel-collector:4318",
      "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL": "http/protobuf",
      "OTEL_SERVICE_NAME": "lightspeed-core",
      "OTEL_PROPAGATORS": "tracecontext,baggage",
      "OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS": "[REDACTED]"
    }
  }
}
```

Values are read from the process environment at request time. Secret-bearing variables shall be redacted. There is no corresponding LCORE config model for tracing.

### API changes

No **required** change to JSON requests/responses. The `/config` response gains `observability.otel` as described above.

### Error handling

- **Request path:** Tracing errors do not change HTTP status for the user.
- **Startup:** Invalid or missing `OTEL_*` values do not block LCORE startup; they affect export only.

### Security considerations

- OTLP endpoint URL and non-secret `OTEL_*` values may appear in the `/config` response via env scraping.
- Bearer tokens, client keys, and sensitive headers stay in **`OTEL_*`** and secret mounts; redact them in `/config` output.
- Span attributes: no raw user ids or secrets.

### Migration / backwards compatibility

- **No tracing by default:** Until operators set **`OTEL_*`** exporter variables and use **`opentelemetry-instrument`**, existing deployments behave as today (no OTLP export).
- New dependencies must not alter runtime when the SDK is disabled.

## New dependencies

- `opentelemetry-distro`
- `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`
- `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`

## Implementation Suggestions

### Key files and insertion points

| File | What to do |
|------|------------|
| `pyproject.toml` | Add OTel API, SDK, OTLP exporter, FastAPI instrumentor, propagators; pin versions per project policy. |
| `src/app/endpoints/config.py` | Scrape `OTEL_*` env vars into `observability.otel` on `/config` response; redact secrets. |
| `app/endpoints/*.py`, `utils/*.py` | Add manual spans around logical sections of request handlers. |
| `Containerfile` | Add OTel packages; set **`ENTRYPOINT`** to **`["opentelemetry-instrument", "python3.12", "src/lightspeed_stack.py"]`**. |
| `docker-compose.yaml` | **`environment`** / **`env_file`**: required **`OTEL_*`** exporter fields. |

## Open Questions

- Which `OTEL_*` variables are included in the `/config` scrape?
